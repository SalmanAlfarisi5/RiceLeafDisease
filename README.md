# Dataset Description
- Rice leaf disease detection image dataset
- Multi-class classification dataset:
    - 5 classes: healthy class and 4 disease classes
- Each image is of size (224, 224, 3)

# Task Expectation
- Need to divide the data evenly for all classes between train and test set
- Usage of different pretraining schemes in case of using CNN models
- Innovative use of training and feature extraction techniques
- Need to find out which samples are being mistaken by the models and try to resolve the issue
